# The Drifter
The Drifter is a low cost self maintained water quality smart buoy. It takes a multitude of data 
points such as water temperature, pH, and conductivity. Power is drawn from an internal battery along
with a solar panel to recharge the battery. The said data is stored on a local SD Card as well as 
sent to a base station through LoRa radio signals.
